There are 35 municipalities within the boundary of Miami-Dade, which are distinct in terms of population density, type of businesses, and lifestyle.

There are 35 municipalities in Miami-Dade, including an 'Unincorporated Miami-Dade' area, which covers mostly the Everglades National Park. This area was later removed from the dataset for analysis, given this area is uninhabited. Then, considering a list of coordinates for each of the municipalities are difficult to find, I used the 'Nominatim' function and Foursquare API in a loop to generate the corresponding coordinates for each municipality according to their names, and insert the coordinates into the dataset.\n\n&emsp;&emsp;  To searching for venues, I defined a function \u2018getNearbyVenues\u2019 to loop through Foursquare API and get 100 venues for each municipality and insert back into the dataset. Within the Miami-Dade County, 6 municipalities have the number of venues under 100, with Sweetwater area having the least of 45 venues. Moreover, I collected the data of population by municipality of Miami-Dade County (United States Census Bureau, 2010) from the US Census Bureau and merged with the municipality dataset for later analysis. \n\n**Methodology**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;  To examine each municipality and conduct clustering, I used the K-means method with 5 clusters. Firstly, I calculated the frequency of occurrence of each venue category by municipality. Then, I selected the top 10 most common venue categories for each area by defining a \u2018most_common_venues\u2019 function. Next, I applied the K-Means clustering method to cluster all the municipalities into 5 clusters based on the category of venues. The number of clusters was chosen based on the elbow methods, where 6 cluster would over split the municipalities, and 4 clusters would not properly group them into clusters with similar attributes. To map the results, I used \u2018folium\u2019 function with geographic API municipality boundary GeoJSON file from Miami-Dade County Open Data Hub (Miami-Dade County GIS Open Data, 2020), and build the choropleth map of population by municipality. Then, I added markers according to the clusters onto the choropleth map. "
